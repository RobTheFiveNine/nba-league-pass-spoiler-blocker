<h1 align="center">NBA League Pass Spoiler Blocker</h1>

The recent updates to NBA League Pass have resulted in several user interface issues which make it near impossible to watch a game without first seeing spoilers; this extension aims to mitigate that.

This extension will automatically enable the "Hide Scores" feature on League Pass and will also remove the background news story which shows the outcome / summary of the game when you click the "Watch Game" option.
